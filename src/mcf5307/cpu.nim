## `cpu` - the core lifecycle and the instruction dispatch of the ColdFire
## ISA_A core.
##
## This module is the top of the core. It owns the part of the `mcf5307_*`
## ABI that runs the machine: the lifecycle calls `mcf5307_create`,
## `mcf5307_destroy` and `mcf5307_reset`, the private `step` procedure, and
## `mcf5307_exec` itself.
##
## `step` decodes one word and then calls the executor of the
## instruction group that the word belongs to. It is therefore the one place
## that must know both the decoder and every executor:
##
##     decode_types            the shared types and the EA legality table
##        ^          ^
##     decode      move, alu
##        ^          ^
##            cpu               this module
##
## `decode` and the executors are level-2 siblings. Neither imports the other.
##
## To add an instruction group: write the new executor module beside
## `move.nim` and `alu.nim`, add one `import` line here, and add one arm to
## the `case decoded.op` below. `decode.nim` gets the new opcodes in its own
## `case` when the group is decoded, but it does not get a new dependency.
## Shared helpers that a second executor needs go down into
## `mcf5307/machine`, not sideways into `move.nim`.
##
## There is no supervisor and user stack split on ISA_A, so the context holds
## a single address register 7. `sp` is that one register. The context type
## lives in `decode_types` with the other shared types.
##
## The exception layout and the reset values are taken from the ColdFire
## Family Programmer's Reference Manual and the MCF5307 User's Manual, and
## from this project's own measurements.
