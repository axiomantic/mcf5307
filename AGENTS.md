# Agents

Instructions for AI coding agents working on this repository.

This repository is part of the Nord Modular G2 emulator project. The work and
the execution ceremony are in `ROADMAP.md` in `nmg2-artifacts`. Read that before
you start a task. This file states the rules that apply while you write code
here.

## Comments and docstrings

The code says what it does. A comment says why this was chosen over the
alternative.

**Never write these in a comment, a docstring, or a test name:**

- A pointer to a task, a plan, a design, or a document section. This has no
  exception. A citation of this project's own specification is forbidden in the
  same way as a citation of a task ledger. Write the fact instead.
- A count of cases, tests, files, symbols, or lines.
- A coverage claim, or any claim about the rest of the tree.
- A list of unfinished work.
- A note about history. Git holds that.

**These are protected. Never remove them:**

- Datasheet and hardware-manual citations.
- Hazard banners.
- Comments inherited from upstream or vendored code.
- A number that a mechanism reads and checks at build time or test time.

**Sweeps are permitted.** You can rewrite comments across many files in one
change. Prove that behaviour did not change: parse each modified Python file
before and after, strip the docstrings, and compare the syntax trees.

## Tests

**Always pass `--no-tests=error` to ctest.** Without it, ctest exits 0 when the
filter matches no test. A pass and an empty run then look the same. This project
has a repository where that exact false green is live today.

Write the failing test first. Confirm that it fails for the intended reason.

A test must consume real values. A test that checks only exit status,
non-emptiness, or truthiness proves nothing. Before you call a test done, plant
a fault and confirm that the test goes red.

## Verify the artifact, not the signal

A step that can do nothing reports success in the same way as a step that
worked. When a step writes a file, regenerates code, or targets a path you did
not name, look at what it produced. Do not read the exit code and stop.

Count with a command. Never estimate a number, and never recall one.

State what you ran next to the result. A rule stated more broadly than what you
tested is false in a way the test will not show you.

## Git

Never push to a default branch without permission. Never force push without
stating what it discards first.

Never run a tree-wide git operation in a checkout you share with anyone:
`git stash`, `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, `git clean -fd`,
`git reset --hard`. To compare against a commit, read it with `git show`.

Never put an issue number in a commit message, a pull request title, or a pull
request body. It notifies every subscriber.

Work in a clone you created yourself. Never delete a path you did not create.

## Searching

`git grep` does not see untracked files. An empty result and an unsearched file
look the same. Use `rg`, and name the tool beside any claim that something
appears nowhere.

Quote every argument that contains a glob character. An unquoted `?` or `*` is
eaten by the shell, the command never runs, and the empty output reads exactly
like a measured absence.

A path that is missing from a default branch is not missing from the repository.
Two repositories here hold their product work on stacked branches. Check the
branch before you report a file as absent.

## This repository

**Licence: MIT. This repository is clean room.**

You can take facts from any source: register addresses, bit layouts, opcode
encodings, timing. You cannot take expression. Never copy code, comments, or
structure from a copyleft source into this repository. Before you move any file
in from a fork, prove that this project wrote it.

Language: Nim. The version is pinned in `.nim-version`. Do not change it in the
same change as any other work.

Build and test:

    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build
    ctest --test-dir build --no-tests=error

The default branch carries no source today. The core is on stacked branches.
