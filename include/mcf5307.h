/* mcf5307.h - the C application binary interface of the MCF5307 ColdFire core
 * and the ISP1181 USB device model.
 *
 * THIS HEADER IS THE CONTRACT AND IT IS REVIEWED AS ONE. The Nim
 * implementation exports these symbols with `{.exportc, cdecl.}` and both
 * sides include this file. C++ owns the board and calls down into this
 * interface; nothing here calls up into C++ except through the C function
 * pointers the board installs at construction time.
 *
 * WHAT CROSSES: fixed-width integers, opaque pointers to context objects
 * allocated on the other side, raw byte buffers with an explicit length, and
 * `cdecl` C function pointers.
 *
 * WHAT NEVER CROSSES: a Nim `string`, `seq`, `ref` or any garbage-collected
 * type; a C++ object, reference or virtual table; a Nim closure; and an
 * exception, in either direction. A fault is reported as a plain integer
 * value through an out-parameter, and never as a thrown object.
 *
 * The two state calls exist so that a scheduler can take a snapshot. The
 * snapshot is a flat byte block of a fixed size with a version word in it,
 * and it holds no pointer.
 *
 * MIT licensed and clean-room with respect to GPL and LGPL code. Register
 * addresses, bit layouts, access widths and opcode encodings are facts about
 * Motorola silicon; the authority to implement from is the Motorola manual
 * set and this project's own measurements.
